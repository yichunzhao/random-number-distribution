Are people equally lucky?

Given 100 persons, each having 100 DKK.

If in one round, each person randomly selects only one person to give out 1 DKK; then iterating this process for many loops.
We want to conclude that the money will evenly go to each person, or say, we want to know are people equally lucky naturally?

I iterated up to 10,000 loops, and I can see people is not naturally lucky. Some will become very rich, and some will become very poor.

Hence, people may be not equally lucky. 

In another brunch, I add another constraint, one person in one round only can receive 1 DKK. However, the result is still the same, rich is still rich, and poor is still poor.
